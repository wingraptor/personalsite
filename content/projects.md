### [Artisan Beards](https://artisanbeards.com)

{{% portfolio image="/images/artisanbeards.webp" alt="Artisan Beards" %}}

###  Description

I originally set up [this](https://artisanbeards.com) website using the Shopify platform to sell beard oils in Barbados. In order to reduce operating costs to a minimum, I rebuilt this website as a static site using Hexo as the static site generator and hosted it using Netlify for free. I modified a freely available theme in order to make this happen.

###  Description

This was my very first [project](https://wingraptor.github.io/beardoilcalc.github.io/index.html) built without using a CMS or pre-built theme. It was built using jQuery, some vanilla JS and CSS (using Bootstrap 4). I built it so that customers of Artisan Beards could find out the amount of beard oil that they should use.
