## [Spotify Playlist Creator](https://spotifyplaylistapp.herokuapp.com/)

![Spotify Playlist](/images/spotify.jpg)

##  Description

This is a web app that creates a Spotify playlist containing tracks from the best 50 albums of 2018 according to [Complex Magazine](https://www.complex.com/music/best-albums-2018/). The Complex Magazine article was parsed for the album names which were then used, via various queries to Spotify APIs, to generate a database of tracks, Spotify track/album IDs, artist names etc. for all 50 albums. This database is then queried to generate a private Spotify playlist of >700 tracks after appropriate authorizations are granted through logging into your account.

See [GitHub Readme](https://github.com/wingraptor/spotifyPlaylist) for a more in-depth description.

&nbsp;

##  Description

I originally set up [this](https://artisanbeards.com) website using the Shopify platform to sell beard oils in Barbados. In order to reduce operating costs to a minimum, I rebuilt this website as a static site using Hexo as the static site generator and hosted it using Netlify for free. I modified a freely available [theme](https://gumroad.com/l/hexo-theme-milan) in order to make this happen.

&nbsp;

##  Description

This was my very first [project](https://wingraptor.github.io/beardoilcalc.github.io/index.html) built without using a CMS or pre-built theme. It was built using jQuery, some vanilla JS and CSS (using Bootstrap 4). I built it so that customers of Artisan Beards could find out the amount of beard oil that they should use.
