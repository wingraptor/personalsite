## [Mobaton-a News](https://tranquil-mountain-25146.herokuapp.com/)

![Spotify Playlist](/images/news.png)

##  Description

This is a news aggregator web app which displays news articles from popular Barbadian news and information websites. Each site is scraped hourly, and article titles, links to the article and other meta information displayed on the homepage. Additionally, a Whatsapp bot was built using Twilio/Node such that, using specific commands, news articles could be retrieved.

This webapp was built using vanilla JS and vanilla CSS (in order to practice core skills) on the front-end, with EJS being used as the templating language. The backend utlises node with express as the web app framework and a NoSQL database(MongoDB).

**Note that site load speed is slow because it currently being hosted on the free Heroku plan, therefore, the instance needs to be spun up after 30mins of activity.**

### See [GitHub Readme](https://github.com/wingraptor/mobatonnews) for a more information.

### [Spotify Playlist Creator](https://spotifyplaylistapp.herokuapp.com/)

![Spotify Playlist](/images/spotify.jpg)

##  Description

This is a web app that creates a Spotify playlist containing tracks from the best 50 albums of 2018 according to [Complex Magazine](https://www.complex.com/music/best-albums-2018/). The Complex Magazine article was parsed for the album names which were then used, via various queries to Spotify APIs, to generate a database of tracks, Spotify track/album IDs, artist names etc. for all 50 albums. This database is then queried to generate a private Spotify playlist of >700 tracks after appropriate authorizations are granted through logging into your account.

### See [GitHub Readme](https://github.com/wingraptor/spotifyPlaylist) for a more in-depth description.

## [Random Quote Generator](https://wingraptor.github.io/quotegenerator/)

![Random Quote Generator](/images/randomQuote.jpg)

##  Description

This web app displays a random quote and related GIF on page load and on click of "New Quote"; oftentimes with hilarious results.
Also be amazed as particles and font highlights change to a random color on each load of new quote and GIF. 

**Sadly the [quote generator API](https://talaikis.com/api/quotes/random/) that I used is no longer active, so this project is essentially non-functional**.

### See [GitHub Readme](https://github.com/wingraptor/quotegenerator) for a more in-depth description.

## [Artisan Beards](https://artisanbeards.com)

![Artisan Beards](/images/artisanbeards.jpg)

&nbsp;

##  Description

I originally set up [this](https://artisanbeards.com) website using the Shopify platform to sell beard oils in Barbados. In order to reduce operating costs to a minimum, I rebuilt this website as a static site using Hexo as the static site generator and hosted it using Netlify for free. I modified a freely available [theme](https://gumroad.com/l/hexo-theme-milan) in order to make this happen.

## [Beard Oil Calculator](https://wingraptor.github.io/beardoilcalc.github.io/index.html)

![Beard Oil Calculator](/images/beardoilcalc.jpg)

&nbsp;

##  Description

This was my very first [project](https://wingraptor.github.io/beardoilcalc.github.io/index.html) built without using a CMS or pre-built theme. It was built using jQuery, some vanilla JS and CSS (using Bootstrap 4). I built it so that customers of Artisan Beards could find out the amount of beard oil that they should use.

Utilising the WordPress CMS I set up a tech blog called Caribbean Tech Boom or [CTBoom](https://ctboom.io).
