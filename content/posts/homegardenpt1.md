## A Fresh, Fresh Start


So today is the day that I finally restart my much neglected home garden. I left it in a state of [fallow](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/fallow), actually who am I kidding, laziness and/or apathy resulted in me abandoning it.  I had originally started this garden project in late 2016, I even took pictures with the goal of sharing the whole process from conception through to harvesting the fruits of my labor, but again apathy and/or laziness got in the way. This time however, I will show the “world” how to start a home garden in a true low cost,  cough cheap cough way. 

Bonus pics of my original home garden from 2016:

## Project Aims
The goal of this project is to create a home garden using materials that most (Caribbean) people would have lying around at home or can easily borrow or buy. Ease and low cost and  is the name of the game and as such a little bit of ingenuity/resourcefulness will be required. I’ll lay down the basics and you can fill in the gaps or replace materials as needed.

&nbsp;

## Required Materials
Here’s what you’ll need for this project:

- Cement blocks
- Old newspapers
- Shovel, Spade or Hoe (no, not that hoe 😒) 
- Dried grass, dried banana leaves or any dry plant matter
- A strong back (Bonus training for Crop Over)

&nbsp;

## Prepping the Area

Choose a suitable location to set up your garden, preferably a flat piece of ground on your own property (unlike me 😅 ). Arrange the concrete blocks in square/rectangle ensuring that the holes are facing up (this will make sense later). Once this is done, you’ll have to clear the top soil to remove grass and as much of the grass roots (heh) as you can. This is to ensure that your crop won’t be competing with grass and weeds.

> ⭐TIP: At this point I recommend putting the grass you’ve removed to a pile in a corner somewhere so that it can dry and be used as compost⭐.

## Laying the Base Layer

> “A solid base is essential for sturdy building” - Akono Brathwaite. 

Like the quote above, having a sturdy base layer is essential for reaping a decent harvest. In this case I’ve laid down dried banana leaves to cover as much exposed soil as possible. The purpose of this layer is  two-fold, to prevent the growth of grass and to act as a slow-releases store of nutrients. Note that you can also use dried grass, any dried plant matter or newspaper for this layer. The final step is to cover the ground in the holes in the cement blocks. I’ve done this by balling up newspaper sheets and placing in each hole……yup, we’ll also be growing plants in these 😉.

## Putting it Together

See, that wasn’t too hard, now that we’ve gotten the initial setup out of the way, the next steps are just to fill the spaces with a Scientifically Proven Substrate Blend™, plant some herb and harvest the fruits (or vegetables) of our hard labor. So look out for my next blog post soon, provided that I don’t procrastinate again 😪.
