Welcome to my blog. This is my very first post ðŸ™Œ and therefore I'm going to answer the who, what and why of this blog. To those of you who may be reading this far into the future, bear in mind that change is guaranteed and the answers to those three questions will change by the time you read this.

## Who am I?
I'm Akono (this shouldn't change) and at the time of writing I'm a beginner when it comes to web development....recursion is still black magic, centering elements using CSS feels like pulling teeth and javascript is well...javascript.

I've dabbled in e-commerce using [Shopify](https://www.artisanbeards.com) and OpenCart and I've blogged using [WordPress](https://www.ctboom.io). I am currently doing the [Colt's Steele Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/) and supplementing it with [FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/concatenating-strings-with-plus-operator).

To be quite honest I don't even know if web development is something that I'll actually enjoy when the going gets tough. As of right now however, I'm completely fascinated with the idea of being able to build whatever website or webapp comes to mind ðŸ¤“.

## What is this blog for?
I see this blog as a space for me to share knowledge gained as I go from a complete beginner to becoming...decent. I intend to tackle really simple topics through the eyes of a beginner; things that an experienced developer may not realize are difficult for beginners.

I'll try to keep my posts quite pointed but light-heartedðŸ’•, focused but tongue-in-cheek ðŸ˜‹, directed but casual (casual emote) etc etc.

On a meta note, you'll be able to see my progression and I'll share techniques, tools and resources that I've used.

## Why am I doing this?
I'm doing this because I've found a way to have 35 hr days and need to use that extra time productively ðŸ˜¶. Okay, back to this reality, I'm doing this both to reinforce what I've learned and to pass on bits of knowledge and insights to others who are just starting out. This site will also act as a test bed for things that I've learned on my journey so don't be surprised if it's layout changes significantly.

Feel free to leave comments and feedback and if you want to extend your days to 35 hrs follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/AkonoBrath).
