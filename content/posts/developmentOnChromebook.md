I know what you're thinking, a Chromebook....for web development. Surely a glorified Chrome browser is not suitable for creating web apps and websites. However, you'd be wrong .

Surprise surprise, I'm a huge Chromebook fan, so much so that my primary device is the [Samsung Chromebook Pro](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/12-14/samsung-chromebook-pro-xe510c24-k01us/). From the time I used my first chromebook, the [Acer C720](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/), I fell in love with their super quick boot up times, hassle-free update handling, excellent battery life and minimalist approach to web browsing.

When I decided to take the plunge to learn web development, my main concern was that a Chromebook would not be adequate and I would have to use my windows machine as my primary learning device. Luckily, I've found workarounds that in my opinion are superior to using traditional windows apps....at least at this nascent stage in my learning process.

## How I do it?

I have two primary resources for learning web development. These are Colt Steele's Web Development [Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/) on Udemy and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/check-for-palindromes). Course content is accessed through a web browser for both of these, however, while freeCodeCamp has an in-built code editor, Colt's course does not. Colt recommended the Windows/Linux/Mac app [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), which is great and all but I was trying to avoid using my Windows machine.

I started out using [Codepen](https://www.codepen.io) which is very simple and...gets the job done, but I wasn't a fan of its layout. It felt a little too far removed from an actual desktop [Integrated development environment(IDE)](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/integrated-development-environment) for my liking. I then gave [Cloud9](https://c9.io/login) a shot, however, I found that it was a bit too complex / feature-rich for my tastes; it is after all part of [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

Luckily I stumbled across [Repl.it](https://www.repl.it) which, in my opinion is an excellent compromise between the accessibility of Codepen and the complexity/feature-richness of Cloud9. Using Repl.it I am able to quickly test HTML, CSS and Js individually or all together to create a fully working website. Repl.it also supports virtually every [programming language / framework](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/repl-it-lets-you-program-in-your-browser/) that you can think of, which future-proofs it for me when I'm ready to learn a new language.

One added benefit of using Repl.it is that my code is saved automatically such that I can access it from any device with an internet browser. I can also embed code that I've written to any website.

Try the code below and see what happensÂ ðŸ˜ˆ.
