      <description>What is the keyword this? &amp;lsquo;this&amp;rsquo; is a reserved word in Javascript and is usually determined by how a function is called, i.e., its execution context. Its value is determined at execution. The value of the keyword this can determined using four &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo;:
 Global Rule Object/implicit Rule Explicit Rule Keyword new Rule  1. Global Context Occurs when the keyword &amp;lsquo;this&amp;rsquo; is outside of a declared object. The value of the keyword &amp;lsquo;this&amp;rsquo; therefore refers to the global object which is the window object for Javascript run in the browser.</description>

      <title>Chunky Monkey Algorithm Challenge🐒</title>

      <description>Today I was able to solve what in reality is a basic Javascript algorithm. For those of you who are more experienced with coding, this algorithm will be easy, but for me, it was a fun challenge. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll attempt to explain the steps that I (eventually) took to solve it. So buckle up buckaroos and join me on a coding journey.
The Chunky Monkey algorithm is part of the FreeCodeCamp Front-End Web Development Certification.</description>

      <title>Web Development on My Chromebook</title>

      <description>I know what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking, a Chromebook&amp;hellip;.for web development. Surely a glorified Chrome browser is not suitable for creating web apps and websites. However, you&amp;rsquo;d be wrong .
Surprise surprise, I&amp;rsquo;m a huge Chromebook fan, so much so that my primary device is the Samsung Chromebook Pro. From the time I used my first chromebook, the Acer C720, I fell in love with their super quick boot up times, hassle-free update handling, excellent battery life and minimalist approach to web browsing.</description>

      <title>Switching It Up With Switch Statements</title>

      <description>What are Switch Statements? This is another form of &amp;lsquo;conditional logic&amp;rsquo; that can be used in a javascript program (think If/else statements). Switch statements are useful when many conditions are being evaluated because they can be easier to type or read compared with using if/else statements.
Syntax switch (expression) { case value1: //Statements executed when the //result of expression matches value1 break; case value2: //Statements executed when the //result of expression matches value2 break; .</description>

      <title>A Beginner&#39;s Introduction to Variables</title>

      <description>In the spirit 👻of keeping things simple and at a beginner level I am going to attempt to explain one of the fundamental aspects of javascript and programming in general, variables. Variables was one of the first concepts that I encountered when I started to learn to code and is one of the easiest to grasp.
What are Variables? Variables are simply containers for storing things called values. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me you&amp;rsquo;ve only ever encountered variables in Mathematics😱 and they are fundamentally the same in programming.</description>

Who am I? I&amp;rsquo;m Akono (this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t change) and at the time of writing I&amp;rsquo;m a beginner when it comes to web development&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Gas Price Calculator  Description This project allows users to get an estimate of fuel prices that will pay in Barbados. I originally built this site using using jQuery, vanilla Js, CSS using the Bulma Framework. I then rebuilt it using utilising Node, Express and EJS as the templating language.
